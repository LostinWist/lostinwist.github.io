                    So I did some math. That should explain how much effort I put into this since I hate math.

                    That is insane! Seriously, take a second to realize 
                    <br>that is 190 indiviual people that went, 
                    <br>"Hey, this guy is awesome, his videos are awesome, 
                    <br>and they are so helpful that I went out of my way to subscribe!"
                    <br> That isn't mindless "like", that is a full concious decision!

                    <br>
                    Now this is more like it! I have no idea how you would make 73 videos, 
                    <br>but if there is anything I know about you..it's that if you want to do something, you will find any possible way to do it.
                </p>
                <p class="mainpost">Either way, if the average increases or not. That is still SUPER impressive!!! Heck, it took my 4 years to get 80 subs...<3</p>
