                <u>Verse</u>
                <br>I've been trying to write you a song to make you feel like...
                <br>like the way I feel when you say my name. 
                <br>Between the hi's and hellos, goodbyes and don't go, 
                <br>but there's one thing that always stays the same.
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>Chorus</u>
                <br>When the lights all fade, you are right there beside me
                <br>If I lose my way, you know which way I need
                <br>If I don't know what to say
                <br>You get me anyways, you get me anyways
                <br>If I lose my mind, you'll be right there beside me 
                <br>In my darkest time, know exactly what I need
                <br>If I don't know what to say
                <br>You get me anyways, you get me anyways
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>Verse</u>
                <br> You donâ€™t know how beautiful you are
                <br> with every heart and every scar 
                <br> And the way your voice brightens up my day
                <br> You're Like an angel in disguise, 
                <br>your words are too wise
                <br>But there's one thing that always stays the same
                <br>
                <br>

                <u>Bridge</u>
                <br>And I hope you know
                <br>I love everything about you from your head to your toes
                <br>And I hope you know
                <br>I wrote this song about you so the whole world will know
